# Supervised Learning Text Classification

Example of an end-to-end Text Classification (i.e., Supervised Learning) employing Topic Modelling and covering the steps of PreProcess (e.g., clean up and validations), Training and Model Exploration, Final Validation, and Explainability.

## Setup Virtual Python Environment

Prepare Python Virtual Environment:
```
python3.10 -m venv venv
```

Install required Python Libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup Dataset

Download `df_file.csv` from [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanishqdublish/text-classification-documentation)

## Train and Evaluate Classification

This [Jupyter Notebook](./Main_Explore_and_Train_Model.ipynb) provides an end-to-end example of preparing a predictor for an unstructured text dataset.

For Examples of Explainability, please refer to the following [Folder](./out/explainability_examples/).
